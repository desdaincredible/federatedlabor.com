            by the selling dealer from which you purchased the tires, provided by Auto Knight Motor Club, Inc.
            ("Provider") and administered by Automotive Business Solutions. ("Program Administrator") P.O. Box 33535,
            Denver, CO 80233. In the states of Florida, Louisiana and Oklahoma the Provider is Lyndon Southern Insurance
            Company 10151 Deerwood Park Blvd., Bldg. 100, Ste. 500, Jacksonville, FL 32256, Tel: (800) 888-2738. In the
            state of Florida, LOTSOLUTIONS, INC. an Administrator is providing administration on behalf of Lyndon
            Southern Insurance Company. This Plan covers only the new tires you purchased (not available on used tires),
            the original purchaser and the original vehicle identified on the original purchase receipt. This Plan only
            applies to passenger and light truck tires, which, during its tread life or within the covered period of
            time, becomes unserviceable because of a road hazard. The Plan and tire purchase must appear on your
            receipt. A road hazard occurs when a tire fails due to a puncture, bruise or break incurred during the
            course of normal driving on a maintained road. Nails, glass, and potholes would be the most common examples
            of road hazard damage.
            <div class="coverage_sub_header">WHAT YOU MUST DO TO OBTAIN SERVICE</div>
            If possible, you should return to the selling dealer where you originally purchased this Plan, for tire
            repair or replacement. If you are away from the original selling dealer, you must contact the Program
            Administrator by calling 866-830-4189 for assistance in locating the nearest participating facility.
            <span class="underline">Prior authorization must be obtained to replace a tire damaged by a road hazard.</span>
            YOU MUST PRESENT THE ORIGINAL INVOICE SHOWING THE PURCHASE OF THE TIRE(S) AND THE PLAN. The damaged tire
            must be made available for inspection by the facility and/or the Program Administrator. All claims and any
            required documentation must be submitted to the facility or the Program Administrator within 60 days of the
            date of failure and/or service. This Plan does not have a deductible.

            <div class="coverage_copy">
                <div class="coverage_sub_header">WHAT IS COVERED BY THE PLAN</div>
                The Plan is valid for a period of 3 years or until any portion of the tire is worn to 2/32 of an inch or
                less, whichever occurs first.<br>
                <b><span class="underline">Tire Replacement</span></b>:If a tire becomes unserviceable because of a road
                hazard during the useable tread life of the tire, it will be replaced with a new tire. If available, an
                exact make/model replacement tire will be installed. If not available, a comparable quality tire will be
                installed. If the tire failure occurs within the first 33% of useable treadwear, and cannot be safely
                repaired per manufacturer's guidelines, the tire will be replaced with coverage up to 100% of the
                original price paid for the tire. After the first 33% of useable treadwear, you will be charged for the
                consumed useable treadwear on the original tire, times the original selling price of the tire. You will
                be responsible for any taxes, mounting, balancing, and any other miscellaneous fees. When the tread is
                worn down to 2/32" the tire is considered worn out and is not eligible for adjustment. If you want a
                Plan on the replacement tire, you must purchase a new Plan for the new tire.<br>
                <b><span class="underline">Tire Repair</span></b>: If your tire is damaged due to a road hazard and can
                be safely repaired, the tire will be repaired per manufacturer's guidelines at any participating
                facility. The Plan will cover up $20.00 to have the tire repaired. The Plan will remain in effect.

                Arbitration is a method of resolving any Claim without filing a lawsuit. In this Arbitration Agreement
                and Class Action Waiver (collectively including all of this section of this Plan), You, We/the
                Administrator and Provider (the "Parties") are agreeing to submit any and all Claims to binding
                arbitration on an individual basis for resolution. This Arbitration Agreement and Class Action Waiver
                sets forth the terms and conditions of our agreement to binding arbitration. The Parties agree that any
                and all claims, disputes and controversies related in any way to this Plan, including but not limited to
                claims related to the underlying transaction giving rise to this Plan, or claims related to the sale,
                financing or fulfillment of this Plan (collectively, "Claims"), shall be resolved by final and binding
                arbitration. "Claims" shall be given the broadest meaning possible and includes, without limitation,
                Claims arising under contract, tort, statute, regulation, rule, ordinance or other rule of law or
                equity, and Claims against any of Administrator's and Provider's owners, shareholders, members,
                affiliates, subsidiaries, divisions, directors, officers, employees, representatives, agents,
                successors, or assigns. "Claims" does not include a statutory claim for public injunctive relief brought
                under any California statute enacted for a public reason, provided that You are a California resident or
                that You purchased Your Plan in California. In arbitration, Claims are resolved by an arbitrator and not
                by a judge or jury. THE PARTIES, INCLUDING YOU, WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO HAVE CLAIMS DECIDED BY A JUDGE OR
                JURY. In addition, except as expressly stated in the Class Action Waiver or otherwise expressly stated
                herein, the arbitrator shall have exclusive authority to decide all issues related to the enforcement,
                applicability, scope, validity, and interpretation of this Arbitration Agreement, including but not
                limited to any unconscionability challenge or any other challenge that the Arbitration Agreement is
                void, voidable or otherwise invalid. Notwithstanding this agreement to arbitrate, each of the Parties
                retains the right to seek remedies in small claims court to resolve any Claim, on an individual basis,
                within the jurisdiction of small claims court. You acknowledge your understanding that all Parties
                hereunder are waiving their rights to go to court, except for small claims court, to resolve any Claims
                arising under or related to this Plan.<br><br>
                The Parties agree and acknowledge that the transaction evidenced by this Plan affects interstate
                commerce. The Parties further agree that all issues relating to this Arbitration Agreement and Class
                Action Waiver, including its enforcement, scope, validity, interpretation, and implementation, will be
                determined pursuant to federal substantive law and the substantive and procedural provisions of the
                Federal Arbitration Act ("Act"), 9 U.S.C. �� 1-16. If federal substantive law holds that state law
                should apply to any issue relating to this Arbitration Agreement and Class Action Waiver, then the law
                of the state where you purchased the Plan shall apply, without regards to conflicts of law.<br><br>
                <b>CLASS ACTION WAIVER. All Claims must be brought solely in an individual capacity, and not as a
                    plaintiff or class member in any purported class action, collective action, representative action,
                    mass action, private attorney general action or action on behalf of the general public, or similar
                    proceeding (any such action is referred to herein as a "Class Action"). NO CLAIM WILL BE ARBITRATED
                    ON A CLASS ACTION BASIS. The Parties, including you, expressly waive any right or ability to bring,
                    assert, maintain, or participate as a class member in any Class Action in court, arbitration, or any
                    other forum, and the right for anyone to do so on Your behalf. The arbitrator may not consolidate
                    more than one person or entity's claims, and may not otherwise preside over any Class Action. The
                    arbitrator shall not have the authority to combine or aggregate multiple persons' or entities'
                    Claims or discovery, to conduct a Class Action or to make an award to any person or entity not a
                    party to the arbitration. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, the Parties agree that the
                    enforcement, applicability, scope, validity, and/or interpretation of this Class Action Waiver shall
                    be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator. If this Class Action
                    Waiver is ruled unenforceable or is interpreted to not prevent a Class Action, then the Arbitration
                    Agreement shall be null and void, and any Claims shall proceed in a court of law and not in
                    arbitration. The Parties agree that if an arbitrator renders a decision regarding the enforcement,
                    applicability, scope, validity, and/or interpretation of this Class Action Waiver, or determines
                    that a Class Action may proceed in arbitration, then: (1) the arbitrator has exceeded his powers,
                    pursuant to �10(a)(4) of the FAA, by taking such action; (2) either party may seek immediate review
                    of that decision by a court of competent jurisdiction; and (3) a court of competent jurisdiction
                    shall apply a "de novo" standard of review of that decision if such standard of review is allowed by
                    the common law or statutes of that state. The Parties, including You, agree that if for any reason a
                    Claim proceeds to Court, rather than arbitration, (1) the Claim will proceed solely on an
                    individual, non-class, non-representative basis, and (2) no Party may be a class representative or
                    class member or otherwise participate in any Class Action.</b><br><br>
                The arbitration shall be administered by the American Arbitration Association ("AAA"). The arbitration
                shall be conducted pursuant to the AAA Consumer Arbitration Rules (the "Code"). Information on AAA and a
                copy of the Code may be found at the following number and URL: American Arbitration Association, (800)
                778-7879, <span class="underline">www.adr.org</span>. The arbitration will be governed by federal
                substantive law and the substantive and procedural provisions of the Federal Arbitration Act ("Act"), 9
                U.S.C. �� 1-16. If federal substantive law holds that state law should apply to any issue relating to
                the arbitration, then the law of the state where you purchased the Plan shall apply, without regards to
                conflicts of law. The arbitration will occur before a single, neutral arbitrator selected in accordance
                with the Code in effect at the time the arbitration is commenced. If your total damage claims (not
                including attorney's fees) do not exceed $25,000, then all Claims shall be resolved by the Code's
                Procedures for the Resolution of Disputes through Document Submission, except that a Party may ask for a
                hearing or the arbitrator may decide that a hearing is necessary. If a hearing is held, you have a right
                to attend the arbitration hearing in person, and You may choose to have any arbitration hearing held in
                the county in which You live, the closest AAA location to Your residence, or via telephone. In the event
                that the specified arbitration forum is unavailable, the Parties may agree on a substitute arbitration
                forum. If the Parties cannot agree, a court of competent jurisdiction may appoint a substitute
                arbitration forum. For information about how to initiate arbitration with the AAA, the Parties may refer
                to the AAA Code and forms at www.adr.org or call (800) 778�7879. If you initiate arbitration with AAA,
                You must pay the AAA filing fee in an amount no greater than the fee you would have to pay if you filed
                a complaint in federal court. The Administrator will pay any remaining Costs of arbitration required by
                the Code ("Arbitration Costs"); however, if the arbitrator determines that any of your claims are
                frivolous, You shall bear all of the Arbitration Costs. If the Provider initiates arbitration against
                you, the Provider will pay the AAA filing fee and the Arbitration Costs. Each party will pay his/her/its
                own attorney's fees, as well as costs relating to proof and witnesses, regardless of who prevails,
                unless applicable law and/or the Code gives a party the right to recover any of those fees from the
                other party. An arbitration award may not be set aside except upon the limited circumstances set forth
                in the Federal Arbitration Act. An award in arbitration will be enforceable under the Federal
                Arbitration Act by any court having jurisdiction. The time for commencing an arbitration asserting any
                Claim shall be determined by reference to the applicable statute(s) of limitations, including the
                applicable rules governing the commencement of the limitations period, and a Claim in arbitration is
                barred to the same extent it would be barred if it were asserted in court of law or equity rather than
                in arbitration.<br><br>
                If any portion of this Arbitration Agreement is deemed invalid or unenforceable, all the remaining
                portions of this Arbitration Agreement shall nevertheless remain valid and enforceable, provided,
                however, that if any portion of the Class Action Waiver is deemed invalid or unenforceable, then this
                Arbitration Agreement shall be invalidated and unenforceable in its entirety. In the event of a conflict
                or inconsistency between this Arbitration Agreement and Class Action Waiver and the other provisions of
                this Plan or any other agreement, this Arbitration Agreement and Class Action Waiver governs.<br><br>
